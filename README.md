# Mixed Precision DNNs: All you need is a good parametrization
Pytorch implementation of the [Differentiable Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11452) 

In this repository, you can find the implementation of the DQ uniform quantizer with the 3-rd type of parametrization (U3), the one which yields the best results among other parametrization variants.
